## These functions create an special matrix object (1) which is able to
## cache its inverse matrix (2)

## Function makeCacheMatrix: This is a constructor for a special matrix object
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function caches the object inverse matrix, so, if it has been already calculated, it doesn't calc it again
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
